   abstract = {States and asylum seekers are at the centre of rapid digital innovation in surveillance, mobility, welfare and identity. Why do some states rush to digitalize asylum systems, while others do not? Why is the pace and form of digitalization within countries uneven within asylum agencies? In this article, we examine drivers of the digitalization of the Swedish state, in particular uneven digitalization within the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket). While many processes were swiftly digitalized, we found that Swedish bureaucrats, rather than politicians or activist lawyers, resisted the adoption of digital evidence within the refugee status determination process, despite enthusiastically digitizing elsewhere. We explore these differences by looking at the historical, institutional and cultural bases of Swedish refugee policy. We present evidence from fieldwork in Sweden and find an unequal pace of digitalization that was largely dependent on the bureaucratic risk-aversion, extant legal norms, and perceived vulnerability to fraud.},

@article{Hein2020,
   abstract = {Digital platforms are an omnipresent phenomenon that challenges incumbents by changing how we consume and provide digital products and services. Whereas traditional firms create value within the boundaries of a company or a supply chain, digital platforms utilize an ecosystem of autonomous agents to co-create value. Scholars from various disciplines, such as economics, technology management, and information systems have taken different perspectives on digital platform ecosystems. In this Fundamentals article, we first synthesize research on digital platforms and digital platform ecosystems to provide a definition that integrates both concepts. Second, we use this definition to explain how different digital platform ecosystems vary according to three core building blocks: (1) platform ownership, (2) value-creating mechanisms, and (3) complementor autonomy. We conclude by giving an outlook on four overarching research areas that connect the building blocks: (1) technical properties and value creation; (2) complementor interaction with the ecosystem; (3) value capture; and (4) the make-or-join decision in digital platform ecosystems.},
